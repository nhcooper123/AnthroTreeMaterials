Module Aims

The aim of this module is to introduce you to some of the cutting-edge methods being used in macroecology and macroevolution, with particular focus on work being done right now at the Museum. Rather than concentrating on learning theory through lectures, the module will introduce you to practical

Assessment
There are two assessments connected to this module.

The first will be

The second, although within this module, technically belongs to the Paleobiology module. Due to the large class size during that module it couldn't happen there so we've moved it here. However, the techniques and concepts are highly relevant to macroecology and macreovolution. Richard Twitchett will provide a full explanation of the assessment during the practical components on Thursday 2nd March.
