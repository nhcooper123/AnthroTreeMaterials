# 7. Practice exercises
#The code above only runs these analyses on a few variables. 
#If you have time, try and run some analyses on the other variables. 
#Here are some example questions to get you started.

#1. What is $\lambda$ for primate social group size?
#2. Make a plot of social group size against home range size.
#3. Perform a PGLS of two variables of your choice.
#4. Does home range size differ significantly among the different primate genera?
#5. What is Blombergâ€™s K for adult body mass?
#6. Plot the primate tree and zoom in on the \textit{Saimiri} genus.
#7. Run a PGLS analysis to determine the relationship between social group size and gestation length. How does this differ from the result obtained with an OLS regression? Plot the result.
