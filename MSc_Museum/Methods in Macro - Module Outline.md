# Methods in Macroecology and Macroevolution
### Module coordinator: Natalie Cooper
### natalie.cooper@nhm.ac.uk

## Module Aims
The aim of this module is to introduce you to some of the cutting-edge methods being used in macroecology and macroevolution, with particular focus on work being done right now at the Museum. Rather than concentrating on learning theory through lectures, the module will introduce you to various ways we collect, analyse and interpret macro-scale data with a large emphasis on practical work, mostly using R. 

## Timetable
There will be one morning and one afternoon session each day. Morning sessions will run from 10am-1pm, afternoon sessions from 2pm-5pm. Not every session will require a full three hours. Instructors for each session are below.

### Thursday 23rd February

**Morning:** What are macroecology and macroevolution? Introduction to the module, assessments, and aims.

**Afternoon:** Macroecology I: Macroecological patterns and diversity indices in R.

*Natalie Cooper (natalie.cooper@nhm.ac.uk)*

### Friday February 24th February

**Morning:** Big Data I: Using Big Data in conservation with the PREDICTS project.

*Andy Purvis (a.purvis@nhm.ac.uk)*

**Afternoon:** Big data II: Using the paleobiology database (PBDB) to get data on fossil species for macroecological and macroevolutionary analyses.

*Terri Cleary (t.cleary@nhm.ac.uk)*


### Monday February 27th February

**Morning:** Comparative Biology: The comparative method, dealing with phylogenetic non-independence in comparative analyses. PGLS in R.

**Afternoon:** Macroevolution I: Macroevolutionary patterns and models of evolution in R.

*Natalie Cooper (natalie.cooper@nhm.ac.uk)*

### Tuesday 28th February

**Morning:** Big data III: Using museum specimen data in macroecological and macroevolutionary analyses. Geometric morphometrics.

*Natalie Cooper (natalie.cooper@nhm.ac.uk)*

**Afternoon:** Macroevolution II: case study using foraminifera

*Isabel Fenton (i.fenton@nhm.ac.uk)*

### Wednesday 1st March

**Morning:** Macroevolution III: Diversification rates and adaptive radiations.

**Afternoon:** Critical thinking: Do you trust your methods?

*Natalie Cooper (natalie.cooper@nhm.ac.uk)*

### Thursday 2nd March AND Friday 3rd March
**All day:** 
Practical: Using fossil assemblages to assess the impact of mass extinction events: comparative palaeoecology of Ordovician and Silurian fossil assemblages.

*Richard Twitchett (r.twitchett@nhm.ac.uk)*

## Assessment
There are two assessments connected to this module.

The first will be based on computer practicals early in the course. These will be done at the end of the practicals, and consist of some online multiple choice questions. No write up will be required and the assessment will be completed by the end of the week, if not the end of the practical. 

The second, although within this module, belongs to the Paleobiology module. Due to the large class size during that module it couldn't happen there so we've moved it here. However, the techniques and concepts are highly relevant to macroecology and macroevolution. Richard Twitchett (r.twitchett@nhm.ac.uk) will provide a full explanation of the assessment during the practical on Thursday 2nd March and Friday 3rd March.
