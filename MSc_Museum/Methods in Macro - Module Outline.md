# Methods in Macroecology and Macroevolution
### Module coordinator: Natalie Cooper
### natalie.cooper@nhm.ac.uk

## Module Aims
The aim of this module is to introduce you to some of the cutting-edge methods being used in macroecology and macroevolution, with particular focus on work being done right now at the Museum. Rather than concentrating on learning theory through lectures, the module will introduce you to various ways we collect, analyse and interpret macro-scale data. 


## Timetable
There will be one morning and one afternoon session each day. Morning sessions will run from 10am-1pm, afternoon sessions from 2pm-5pm. It is likely not every session will require a full three hours. Instructors for each session are below.

Assessment
There are two assessments connected to this module.

The first will be

The second, although within this module, technically belongs to the Paleobiology module. Due to the large class size during that module it couldn't happen there so we've moved it here. However, the techniques and concepts are highly relevant to macroecology and macreovolution. Richard Twitchett will provide a full explanation of the assessment during the practical components on Thursday 2nd March.
