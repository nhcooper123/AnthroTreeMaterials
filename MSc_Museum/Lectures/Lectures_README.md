# Lecture slides and how to view them

In an attempt to teach myself something new I decided to write all my lectures in R. 
This has advantages - you can use R output in your slides easily, you can version control everything, and everything is open and placed on GitHub.

I have however also come across some issues that I haven't had time to find good solutions for.
I also recognise that as students you don't necessarily want new stuff, you want the old familiar tools of PDFs and PowerPoints.
Apologies for making your lives a tiny bit harder! 

My lecture slides are available online (I will put the other contributors slides into the DropBox asap):

* [Introduction](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/intro.html)
* [What is macroecology?](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/macroecology.html)
* [What is macroevolution?](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/macroevolution.html)
* [Diversity indices (introduction)](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/diversity.html)
* [The comparative method and PGLS](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/macromodels.html)
* [Macroevolutionary models (introduction)](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/macromodels.html)

## Slide Navigation

A cool (or annoying - depends on your perspective) thing about these presentations is that they autosize to the window you're viewing them in.

* Make the text and pictures bigger: `ctrl +` (or `cmd +`)
* Make the text and pictures smaller: `ctrl -` (or `cmd -`)
* See all the slides on one page: `a` (press it again to go back to one slide per page)
* Remove the footnote bar: `f` (press it again to see the footnote)
* Navigate between slides click "Contents" in the footnote and it'll give you the titles of all the slides to choose from.

## Offline use of slides

I haven't found a good way of doing this yet, however, for now your best bet is going to the `.Rmd` versions of the slides (links below), then saving the page as a PDF. 
These are slightly messy, but all the notes and figures will appear.
When you try and save the HTML versions above to PDF the pagination is off leadign to half the slides being split across pages.
