# Lecture slides and how to view them

In an attempt to teach myself something new I decided to write all my lectures in R. 
This has advantages - you can use R output in your slides easily, you can version control everything, and everything is open and placed on GitHub.

Interactive lecture slides are available online at these links:

* [Introduction](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/intro.html)
* [What is macroecology?](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/macroecology.html)
* [What is macroevolution?](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/macroevolution.html)
* [Diversity indices (introduction)](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/diversity.html)
* [The comparative method and PGLS](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/macromodels.html)
* [Macroevolutionary models (introduction)](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_Museum/Lectures/macromodels.html)

__They may take a while to load, and may also need the text adjusting immediately (see below for instructions).__

## Slide Navigation

A cool (or annoying - depends on your perspective) thing about these presentations is that they autosize to the window you're viewing them in.

* Make the text and pictures bigger: `ctrl +` (or `cmd +`)
* Make the text and pictures smaller: `ctrl -` (or `cmd -`)
* See all the slides on one page: `a` (press it again to go back to one slide per page)
* Remove the footnote bar: `f` (press it again to see the footnote)
* Navigate between slides click "Contents" in the footnote and it'll give you the titles of all the slides to choose from.

## Offline use of slides

I recognise that as students you don't necessarily want new stuff, you want the old familiar tools of PDFs and PowerPoints, so I've also included PDFs in the DropBox folder (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9nezvekzxailcs0/AABX7Ev1P_BBuhA0lltiN2Xua?dl=0).
They don't look as nice, but they are there if you need them.
