# Module aims

- The aim of this module is to introduce you to some of the cutting-edge methods being used in macroecology and macroevolution
- The module will introduce you to various ways we collect, analyse and interpret macro-scale data with a large emphasis on practical work, mostly using R. 

# Module outline

- Macroecology and macroevolution
- Big data – databases, specimens
- Patterns, methods etc.
    - Diversity indices
    - PGLS
    - Diversification rates
    - Geometric morphometrics (modified!)

Critical thinking: Do you trust your methods? - see next slide

Assessment II

# Critical thinking

Papers are in the DropBox

1 = 
2 = 
3 = 
4 = 

# Assessment I

- At the end of every practical there will be some practice questions. 
- <p class="lime"> Save your answers and R CODE </p>
- Assessment will be MCQ test where the answers come from the practice questions or the code you used to answer them. 
- <p class="pink"> I'll share a link on Friday afternoon</p>
- You’ll have til midnight Friday 2nd March to do this.
- Shouldn't take more than 30 mins...

# Assessment II

- Technically not part of this module (part of the Palaeobiology module).
- Short report which requires some data collection, a bit of R (you'll learn how to do this today), and a bit of write up.
- You'll have two days timetabled for this, plus Monday to write up.

<p class="pink">Richard Twitchett will give all instructions tomorrow</p>

# How is this module going to work?

- Focus on reading and doing, rather than sitting through lectures.
- Lectures = short, main points
- Practicals = longer with lots of associated notes. 
- Lots of chance to ask questions, discuss with neighbours, actively learn.
- Practicals with all notes and run R code available for reference.

# Flipped classroom?

# Practical handouts

- Download the whole folder to your computer.
- Handouts available in three different versions
    - R Notebooks
    - Online book
    - PDF book

# Why so many versions?

- Reference for projects
- Reduces note taking
- Easy to share beyond this course
- People learn in different ways and prefer different media 
- Online book is nicer to read with better formatting.
- RNotebook keeps outputs a surprise 
- Computer issues/internet access

# Why so many versions?

# R Notebooks

- Navigate to the folder for today's practical
- Open the .Rmd file in RStudio
- Maximise the script window (you won't need the console or other windows often)
- Read the notes and run code when you get to it...
- Outputs appear as you run the code.
- Bit harder to read text.

# Online book

- Navigate to: https://goo.gl/WJ0D2R
- Work your way through, copy pasting code into an R script.
- Remember to set the working directory to the correct folder.
- Outputs are visible.
- Need internet connection.
- Nicer formatting (easier to read)

# PDF book
- In the folder.
- Work your way through, copy pasting code into an R script.
- Remember to set the working directory to the correct folder.
- Outputs are visible.
- Don't need internet.

# Today
- What is macroecology?
- Diversity indices in R.
- What is macroevolution?
- Visualising phylogenies in R.
