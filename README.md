## Older materials
Note this repo used to contain a number of older practicals, however I have updated several of these.

* 2010-2012. AnthroTree PGLS workshop materials can now be found [here](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/TeachingMaterials/master/MSc_UCL/PGLSinR.html), or as part of the *Methods in Macroecology and Macroevolution module* handouts [here](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/macro-methods-module/master/MacroModule/_book/phylogenetic-generalised-least-squares-pgls-in-r.html).
* 2014. Linnaean Society Radiations in Deep Time workshop on *Macroevolutionary models* can now be found as part of the *Methods in Macroecology and Macroevolution module* [here for continuous traits](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/macro-methods-module/master/MacroModule/_book/macroevolutionary-models-in-r-part-1-continuous-traits.html) and [here for discrete traits](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/macro-methods-module/master/MacroModule/_book/macroevolutionary-models-in-r-part-2-discrete-traits.html). Part 2 was written mostly by Graham Slater.
