A compiled pdf of my section is available [here](http://figshare.com/articles/Models_of_evolution_problem_set_Linnaean_Society_2014/1237122). The data, tree and TeX file  are in the folder above.

Note this repo used to contain AnthroTree materials, however I have updated this practical and it can now be found in the MSc_UCL folder.
